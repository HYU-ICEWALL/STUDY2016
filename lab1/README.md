# Lab1 : To get close with C

A "Hello, world!" program is often used to introduce beginning programmers to a programming language.
According to tradition, we will write "Hello, world!" program.


```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char * argv[])
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
> [Hello, world.c](https://github.com/MaybeS/STUDY2016/blob/master/lab1/Hello, world.c)

There are three thing to learn in this chapter.

- Variable
- Function
- #include Directive

# C like a recipe
C program code is like a recipe.
In recipe, there are sevral ingredients for cooking.
And written how to handle ingredients which prepared.
Finally, there is the result.

The difference between recipe and C code is only we can eat result of recipe, but code can't

## Variable

## function
The structure of function like this.
```
return_type function_name(arg_type arg_name, ...)
{
    /*codes*/
}
```

## #include Directive
